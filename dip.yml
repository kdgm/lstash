compose:
  files:
    - docker-compose.yml
    - docker-compose.override.yml # platform specific overrides

  # Specify project name explicitly to avoid name collisions:
  # docker-compose uses the compose file's folder name as the project name by default,
  # which could be the same for different projects (e.g., if you store docker-compose.yml
  # in the .devcontainer/ folder)

  # NOTE: We deliberately do not set project_name  to prevent collissions
  # between git work trees.
  # Let the name be determined automatically from the base directory name.
  # project_name: UNSET DELIBERATELY
